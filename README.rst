Dev Quick Start
===============

1. Install docker engine and docker compose
#. docker-compose build
#. docker-compose up
#. when postgresql errors, CTRL-C and re-run docker-compose up

Browse to `the application <http://localhost:8000/>`_. No news items are
visible yet because the celery task that leeches new entries has not run
yet. You can initiate a leech run::

  # in a new terminal
  $ docker-compose exec nagg_app bash
  root@17f8c7449778:/#  ./activate_nagg_env.sh
  bash: cannot set terminal process group (1187): Inappropriate ioctl for device
  bash: no job control in this shell
  (nagg_ve) nagg@17f8c7449778:/$ nagg_manage nagg_run

Now observe lots of output on the terminal that is running the
`docker-compose up`.
